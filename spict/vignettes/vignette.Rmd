# Getting started
This vignette explains basic and more advanced functions of the `spict` package. The package is installed from gihtub using the `devtools` package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mawp/spict/spict")
```
installs the stable version of `spict` and 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mawp/spict/spict", ref = "dev")
```
installs the current development version that has new features, but it is not fully tested yet. When loading the package you are notified which version of the package you have installed:

```{r}
library(spict)
```
The printed version follows the format ver\@SHA, where ver is the manually defined version number and SHA refers to a unique commit on [github](https://github.com/mawp/spict). The content of this vignette pertains to the version printed above that can be found  [here](`r paste0("https://github.com/mawp/spict/tree/", packageDescription("spict")$GithubSHA1)`). 

# Loading built-in example data 

The package contains the catch and index data analysed in Polacheck et al. (1993). This data can be loaded by typing

```{r}
data(pol) 
```

Data on three stocks are contained in this dataset: South Atlantic albacore, northern Namibian hake, and New Zealand rock lobster. Here focus will be on the South Atlantic albacore data. This dataset contains the following

```{r}
pol$albacore
```

Note that data are structured as a list containing the entries `obsC` (catch observations), `timeC` (time of catch observations), `obsI` (index observations), and `timeI` (time of index observations). If times are not specified it is assumed that the first observation is observed at time 1 and then sequentially onward with a time step of one year. It is therefore recommended to always specify observation times.

# \label{pldat} Plotting data 

The data can be plotted using the command

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5.5, out.width='0.5\\textwidth', fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.data(pol$albacore)
```

Note that the number of catch and index observations are given in the respective plot headers. Furthermore, the color of individual points shows when the observation was made and the corresponding colors are shown in the color legend in the top left corner. For illustrative purposes let's try shifting the data a bit

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5.5, out.width='0.5\\textwidth', fig.show='hold'}
inpshift <- pol$albacore
inpshift$timeC <- inpshift$timeC + 0.3
inpshift$timeI <- inpshift$timeI + 0.8
plotspict.data(inpshift)
```

Now the colours show that catches are observed in the spring and index in the autumn.

# \label{advpldat} Advanced data plotting

There is also a more advanced function for plotting data, which at the same time does some basic model fitting (linear regression) and shows the results

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.ci(pol$albacore)
```

The two top plots come from `plotspict.data`, with the dashed horizontal line representing a guess of MSY. This guess comes from a linear regression between the index and the catch divided by the index (middle row, left). This regression is expected to have a negative slope. A similar plot can be made showing catch versus catch/index (middle row, right) to approximately find the optimal effort (or effort proxy). The proportional increase in the index as a function of catch (bottom row, right) should show primarily positive increases in index at low catches and vice versa. Positive increases in index at large catches could indicate model violations. In the current plot these are not seen.

# Fitting the model

The model is fitted to data by running

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
res <- fit.spict(pol$albacore)
```

Here the call to `fit.spict` is wrapped in the `system.time` command to check the time spent on the calculations. This is obviously not required, but done here to show that fitting the model only takes a few seconds. The result of the model fit is stored in `res`, which can either be plotted using `plot` or summarised using `summary`. 

The results are returned as a list that contains output as well as input. The content of this list is

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
names(res)
```

Many of these variables are generated by `TMB::sdreport()`. In addition to these `spict` includes the list of input values (`inp`), the object used for fitting (`obj`), the result from the optimiser (`opt`), the time spent on fitting the model (`computing.time`), and more less useful variables.

# Interpreting the summary of results

The results are summarised using

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
capture.output(summary(res))
```

Here the `capture.output()` is only used to provide line numbers for easier reference, but the `summary()` command works without this. 

- Line 1: Convergence of the model fit, which has code 0 if the fit was succesful. If this is not the case convergence was not obtained and reported results should not be used. In case of non-convergence results will still be reported to aid diagnosis of the problem. 
- Line 2: Objective function value at the optimum. The objective function is the likelihood function if priors are not used and the posterior density function if priors are used.
- Line 3: The Euler time step used in the calculation.
- Line 4: Number of observations for the time series used.
- Line 6-9: Summary of the priors used in the fit. The priors shown here are the default priors that are applied when priors are unspecified. These are relatively uninformative and are applied because most data-limited situations do not allow simultaneous estimation of all noise parameters and `logn`. The default priors can be disabled (see the section on priors).
- Line 11-25: Summary of the parameter estimates and their 95% CIs. These can be extracted as a data frame with `sumspict.parest(res)`. 
- Line 27-31: Estimates of deterministic reference points with 95% CIs. These are the reference points one would derive if stochasticity were ignored. Can be extracted with `sumspict.drefpoints(res)`.
- Line 32-36: Estimates of stochastic reference points with 95% CIs. These are the reference points of the stochastic model. The column ´rel.diff.Drp´ shows the relative difference when compared to the deterministic reference points. The information can be extracted with `sumspict.srefpoints(res)`.
- Line 38-43: State estimates in the final year where data were available. The states of the model are biomass (`B`) and fishing mortality (`F`) with the year of the estimates appended. The year is shown as a decimal number as estimates within year are possible. Both absolute (`B` and `F`) and relative estimates (`B/Bmsy` and `F/Fmsy`) are shown. The relative estimates are calculated using the type of reference points given by `msytype` (line 38), where `s` is stochastic and `d` is deterministic. Here `msytype` is ´s´. This information can be extracted using `sumspict.states(res)`.
- Line 45-52: Predictions of absolute and relative biomass and fishing mortality at the time indicated by `inp$timepredi`, here 1990 (line 47-50). In addition, predicted catch at the time indicated by `inp$timepredc` (line 51). Finally, the equilibrium biomass, indicated by E(B_inf), if current conditions remain constant. There predictions or forecasts are calculated under the fishing scenario given by `inp$ffac`. See the section on forecasting for more information. The prediction summary can be extracted using `sumspict.predictions(res)`.

# Plotting and interpreting results

`spict` comes with several plotting abilities. The basic plottin of the results is done using the generic function `plot` that produces a multipanel plot with the most important outputs.

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
plot(res)
```

Some general comments can be made regarding the style and colours of these plots:

- Estimates (biomass, fishing mortality, catch, production) are shown using blue lines.
- 95% CIs of absolute quantities are shown using dashed blue lines.
- 95% CIs of relative biomass and fishing mortality are shown using shaded blue regions.
- Estimates of reference points ($B_{MSY}$, $F_{MSY}$, $MSY$) are shown using black lines.
- 95% CIs of reference points are shown using grey shaded regions.
- The end of the data range is shown using a vertical grey line.
- Predictions beyond the data range are shown using dotted blue lines.
- Data are shown using points coloured by season. Different index series use different point characters (not shown here).

The individual plots can be plotted separately using the `plotspict.*` family of plotting functions; all functions are summarised in Table 1 and their common arguments that control their look in Table 2:

Table: Common arguments in the `plotspict.*` family of funtions

We will now look at them one at a time. The top left is the plot of absolute biomass

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.biomass(res)
```

Note that this plot has a y-axis on the right side related to the relative biomass ($B_t/B_{MSY}$). The shaded 95% CI region relates to this axis, while the dashed blue lines relate to the left y-axis indicating absolute levels. The dashed lines and the shaded region are shown on the same plot to make it easier to assess whether the relative or absolute levels are most accurately estimated. Here, the absolute are more accurate than the relative. Later, we will see examples of the opposite. The horizontal black line is the estimate of $B_{MSY}$ with 95% CI shown as a grey region.

The plot of the relative biomass is produced using

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.bbmsy(res)
```

This plot contains much of the same information as given by `plotspict.biomass`, but without the information about absolute biomass and without the 95% CI around the $B_{MSY}$ reference point.

The plots of fishing mortality follow the same principles

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3.3, fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.f(res, main='', qlegend=FALSE, rel.axes=FALSE, rel.ci=FALSE)
plotspict.ffmsy(res, main='', qlegend=FALSE)
```

The estimate of $F_{MSY}$ is shown with a horizontal black line with 95% CI shown as a grey region (left plot). The 95% CI of $F_{MSY}$ is very wide in this case. As shown here it is quite straightforward to remove the information about relative levels from the plot of absolute fishing mortality. Furthermore, the argument `main=''` removes the heading and `qlegend=FALSE` removes the colour legend for data points.

The plot of the catch is produced using

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
plotspict.catch(res)
```

This plot shows estimated catches (blue line) versus observed catches (points) with the estimate of $MSY$ plotted as a horizontal black line with its 95% CI given by the grey region.

# Using effort data instead of commercial CPUE

# Simulating data
The package has built-in functionality for simulating data. 

## Annual data

Data are simulated using an input list, e.g. `inp`,  containing parameter values specified in `inp$ini`. To simulate data using default parameters run

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- check.inp(pol$albacore)
sim <- sim.spict(inp)
plotspict.data(sim)
```

This will generate catch and index data of same length as the input catch and index time series (here 23 of each) at the time points of the input data. Note when plotting simulated data, the true biomass and fishing mortality are also included in the plot. 

Another simple example is

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- list(ini=list(logK=log(100), logm=log(10), logq=log(1)))
sim <- sim.spict(inp, nobs=50)
plotspict.data(sim)
```

Here the required parameters are specified (the rest use default values), and the number of observations is specified as an argument to `sim.spict()`.

A more customised example including model fitting is

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
set.seed(31415926)
inp <- list(ini=list(logK=log(100), logm=log(10), logq=log(1),
                     logbkfrac=log(1), logF0=log(0.3), logsdc=log(0.1),
                     logsdf=log(0.3)))
sim <- sim.spict(inp, nobs=30)
res <- fit.spict(sim)
sumspict.parest(res)
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
plotspict.biomass(res, stamp='')
plotspict.f(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.catch(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.fb(res, stamp='')
```

Here the ratio between biomass in the initial year relative to `K` is set using `logbkfrac`, the initial fishing mortality is set using `logF0`, process noise of `F` is set using `logsdf`, and finally observation noise on catches is specified using `logsdc`. 

When printing the summary of the parameter estimates the true values are included as well as a check whether the true value was inside the 95% CIs. Similarly, the true biomass, fishing mortality, and reference points are included in the results plot using a yellow/orange colour.

## Seasonal data

It is possible to simulate seasonal data. Additional variables must be specified in the input list that define the type of seasonality to be used. Spline based seasonality is shown first (`inp$seasontype = 1`). This is the default and therefore need not be explicitly specified. It is required that number of seasons is specified using `nseasons` (typically 4), the order of the spline must be specified using `splineorder` (typically 3), time vectors for catch and index containing subannual time points must be specified, and finally the spline parameters (`logphi`) must be set. With four seasons `logphi` must be a vector of length 3, where each value in the vector gives the log fishing intensity relative to level in season four, which is `log(1)`. An example of simulating seasonal data using a spline is

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.show='hold'}
set.seed(1234)
inp <- list()
inp$dteuler <- 1/16
inp$nseasons <- 4
dt <- 1/inp$nseasons
inp$splineorder <- 3
nyears <- 30
inp$timeC <- seq(0, nyears-dt, by=dt)
inp$obsC <- rep(1, length(inp$timeC))
inp$timeI <- seq(0, nyears-dt, by=dt)
inp$obsI <- rep(1, length(inp$timeC))
inp$ini <- list(logK=log(100), logm=log(20), logq=log(1),
                logbkfrac=log(1), logsdf=log(0.4), logF0=log(0.5))
inp$ini$logphi <- log(c(0.05, 0.1, 1.8))
sim <- sim.spict(inp)
res <- fit.spict(sim)
plotspict.data(sim)
plotspict.biomass(res)
plotspict.f(res, qlegend=FALSE)
plotspict.season(res)
```

The data plot shows clear seasonality in the catches. In the results plots, the model is able to estimate the seasonal variation in fishing mortality as seen both in the plot of `F` and in the plot of the estimated spline, where blue is the estimated spline, orange is the true spline, and green is the spline if time were truly continuous (it is discretised with the steps show by the blue line).

## Checking estimation performance of the model

# Estimation using catch and effort data

# Estimation using two or more biomass indices
The estimation can be done using more than one biomass index, for example when scientific surveys are performed more than once every year or when there are both commercial and survey CPUE time-series available.

# Estimation using quarterly data
If there is catch information available in sub-annual aggregations, e.g. quarterly catch we can fit estimate the seasonal pattern of the fishing mortality $F$. The user can choose between the two types of seasonality that are implemented by setting the `seasontype` argument to 1 or 2:

  1. using cyclic B-splines
  2. using coupled SDE's

Further, the number of seasons in a year can be set using the `seasons` to 1, 2, or 4.

# Extracting estimates

To extract an estimated quantity, here `logBmsy` use

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
get.par('logBmsy', res)
```

This returns a vector with `ll` being the lower 95% limit of the CI, `est` being the estimated value, `ul` being the upper 95% limit of the CI, `sd` being the standard deviation of the estimate, and `cv` being the coefficient of variation of the estimate. The estimated quantity can also be returned on the natural scale (as opposed to log scale) by running

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
get.par('logBmsy', res, exp=TRUE)
```

This essentially takes the exponential of `ll`, `est` and `ul` of the values in log, while `sd` is unchanged as it is the standard deviation of the quantity on the scale that it is estimated (here log). When transforming using `exp=TRUE` the $CV = \sqrt{e^{\sigma^2}-1}$. Most parameters are log-transformed under estimation and should therefore be extracted using `exp=TRUE´.

For a standard fit (not using robust observation error, seasonality etc.), the quantities that can be extracted using this method are

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
sort(unique(c(names(res$value), names(res$par.fixed), names(res$par.random))))
```

These should be relatively self-explanatory when knowing that reference points ending with `s` are stochastic and those ending with `d` are deterministic, quantities ending with `p` are predictions and quantities ending with `l` are estimates in the final year. If a quantity is available both on natural and log scale and it is preferred to transform the quantity from log as most quantities are estimated on the log scale.

## Extracting correlation between parameters

The covariance between the model parameters (fixed effects) can be extracted from the results list

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
res$cov.fixed
```

It is however easier to interpret the correlation rather than covariance. The correlation matrix can be calculated using 

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
cov2cor(res$cov.fixed)
```

For this data most parameters are well separated, i.e. relatively low correlation, perhaps with the exception of `logm` and `logn`, which have a correlation of $-0.9$. Note that `logr` is absent from the covariance matrix. This is because the model is parameterised in terms of `logm`, `logK`, and `logn` from which `logr` can be derived. The estimate of `logr` is reported using TMB's `sdreport()` function and can be extracted using `get.par()`.

The covariance between random effects (biomass and fishing mortality) is not reported automatically, but can be obtained by setting `inp$getJointPrecision` to `TRUE` (this entails longer computation time and memory requirement).

The covariance between sdported values (i.e. the values reported in `res$value`) are given in `res$cov`. As this matrix is typically large, the function `get.cov()` can be used to extract the covariance between two scalar quantities

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
cov2cor(get.cov(res, 'logBmsy', 'logFmsy'))
```

This reveals that for this data set the estimates of log Fmsy and log Bmsy are highly correlated. This is often the case and the reason why the model is reparameterised. 

# Setting initial parameter values

Initial parameter values used as starting guess of the optimiser can be set using `inp$ini`. For example, to specify the initial value of `logK` set

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- pol$albacore
inp$ini$logK <- log(100)
```

This procedure generalises to all other model parameters. If initial values are not specified they are set to default values. To see the default initial value of a parameter, here `logK`, run

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- check.inp(pol$albacore)
inp$ini$logK
```

This can also be done posterior to fitting the model by printing `res$inp$ini$logK`.

## Checking robustness to initial parameter values

# Phases and how to fix parameters

The `spict`-package has the ability to estimate parameters in phases. Users familiar with AD model builder will know that this means that some parameters are held constant in phase 1, some are then released and estimated in phase 2, more are released in phase 3 etc. until all parameters are estimated. Per default all parameters are estimated in phase 1. As an example the standard deviation on the biomass process, `logsdb`, is estimated in phase 2:

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- pol$albacore
inp$phases$logsdb <- 2
res <- fit.spict(inp)
```

Phases can also be used to fix parameters to their initial value by setting the phase to `-1`. For example

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
inp <- pol$albacore
inp$phases$logsdb <- -1
inp$ini$logsdb <- log(0.1)
res <- fit.spict(inp)
summary(res)
```

# Priors

## Priors on random effects

## Fixing parameters using priors

## Default priors and how to disable them

# Pitfalls when fixing parameters and specifying priors

Particular caution is required when fixing a parameter that is highly correlated with other parameters because this will to some extent restrict the estimates of the correlated parameters. This could also be a problem when specifying priors depending on the amount of a priori information available. 

# Seasonality

# Robust estimation (reducing influence of outliers)

Estimation becomes less stable

Perhaps fix some parameters

# Simulation

# Forecasting

To make a catch forecast a forecast interval needs to be specified. This is done by specifying the start of the interval (`inp$timepredc`) and the length of the interval in years (`inp$dtpredc`). In addition to the forecast interval a fishing scenario needs to be specified. This is done by specifying a factor (`inp$ffac`) to multiply the current fishing mortality by (i.e. the F at the last time point of the time period where data are available) and the time that management should start (`inp$manstart`). The time point of the reported forecast of biomass and fishing mortality can be controlled by setting `inp$timepredi`. Producing short-term forecasts entails minimal additional computing time.

Forecasts are produced as part of the usual model fitting. To illustrate the procedure, a short example using the South Atlantic albacore dataset of Polacheck et al. (1993) containing catch and commercial CPUE data in the interval 1967 to 1989 is presented. The code to obtain the forecasted annual catch in the interval starting 1991 under a management scenario where the fishing pressure is reduced by 25% starting in 1991, and a forecasted index in 1992 is:

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
library(spict)
data(pol)
inp <- pol$albacore
inp$manstart <- 1991
inp$timepredc <- 1991
inp$dtpredc <- 1
inp$timepredi <- 1992
inp$ffac <- 0.75
res <- fit.spict(inp)
```

To specifically show forecast results use

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
sumspict.predictions(res)

This output is also shown when using `summary(res)`. The results can be plotted using `plot(res)`, however to visualise the change in forecasted fishing mortality and associated change in forecasted catch more clearly we use

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
par(mfrow=c(2, 2), mar=c(4, 4.5, 3, 3.5))
plotspict.bbmsy(res, stamp='')
plotspict.ffmsy(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.catch(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.fb(res, man.legend=FALSE, stamp='')
```

Note in the plot that the decrease in fishing pressure results in a constant biomass as opposed to the expected decrease if fishing effort had remained constant.

SPiCT has a function that runs several predefined management scenarios, which can be presented in a forecast table. To perform the calculations required to produce the forecast table run:

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
res <- manage(res)
```

where `res` is the result of `fit.spict()` from the code above. Then, the results can be summarised (and extracted) by running:

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
df <- mansummary(res)
```

Then, `df` is a data frame with each line containing a line of the output

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.show='hold'}
head(df)
```

The resulting biomass, fishing mortality and catch of the management scenarios are included in the standard plots

```{r, results='show', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.show='hold'}
par(mfrow=c(2, 2), mar=c(4, 4.5, 3, 3.5))
plotspict.bbmsy(res, stamp='')
plotspict.ffmsy(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.catch(res, qlegend=FALSE, stamp='')
plotspict.fb(res, man.legend=FALSE, stamp='')
```

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
